Since release 1.4.0 NovaRS switched to CMake build system (www.cmake.org).
To compile software issue

cmake .
make
make install


If you don't have/don't want CMake, you can use old way

make -f Makefile.custom
make install


If you want to start daemon automatically at startup you can use script
(NovaRS src dir)/scripts/novars. Note this script written for Debian GNU/Linux 
and should be adapted  to use in other distributions. If you send me script for 
your Linux distribution I shall be glad to include it in the next NovaRS release.


If you are Debian/Ubuntu user you can build deb package using

fakeroot debian/rules binary



Enjoy!
